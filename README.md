(2) Select sites of interests based on research region and time period.
(3) Extract time series of each parameter from measurements (refractive indices, particle size, single scattering albedo, aerosol optical depth, Angstrom exponent, asymmetry factor). 
(4) Time processing and time series analysis. 
(5) Couple with satellite measurements.
